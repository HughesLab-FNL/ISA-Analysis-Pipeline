Annotated integration site report column descriptions. The optional HIV alignments are 
not annotated.

Count – The number of times that PCR product appeared in the data.

Seq ID – The sequence ID of one of the PCR products in with those particular data.
Can be used to search for the sequence and others like it in the intermediate data files.

MID – The ten random bases on the primer.

Junction chr – The chromosome where you find the site.

Junction strand – The orientation of the provirus relative to the reference genome.

Junction base – Where the first human base after the junction. The same site will 
differ +/- 5 bases versus the 3LTR and 5LTR because of the five-base duplication.

Breakpoint chr – The chromosome where the fragment ends. Should match junction chr.

Breakpoint strand – Should be opposite the junction strand.

Breakpoint base – There base where the fragment ends. Should be on the same chromosome. 

Length – The length of the PCR product. The absolute value of the breakpoint base minus 
the junction base.

HIV LTR – Which LTR junction the read is from. The 3LTR and 5LTR are always amplified 
on the sense and antisense strands, respectively. This is what’s indicated in the parentheses. 

Provirus orientation – The orientation of the provirus relative to the reference genome.

Prediction – The script guesses if the fragment may be the result of non-specific priming 
to the genome. It compares the end of the primer to the 30 bases upstream of the integration
211sites and warns you if it finds a 70% match to the reference in a 10- base stretch.

Upstream 30 – The thirty reference bases upstream of the integration site.

Downstream 30 – The thirty reference bases downstream of the integration site.

Read 1 – The unedited first read of the pair.

Read 2 – The unedited second read of the pair.
