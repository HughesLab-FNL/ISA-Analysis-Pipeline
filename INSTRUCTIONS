Before running the scripts, change the path to the modules to your directory at
line 18 of _1demultiplex.pl and line 16 of _2blat_pipeline.pl and make sure
the variables on lines 21 to 36 of _2blat_pipeline.pl are specific to your system
and desired analysis.

ISA pipeline quick steps:

1.	Set your working directory to the directory that contains your fastq.gz files. Copy a settings file template to the folder containing your fastq.gz files. Edit the
	settings file to be specific for your data.

2.	Copy a settings file template to the folder containing your fastq.gz files. Edit the
	settings file to be specific for your data.

3.	Run 1_demultiplex.pl on the command line with your settings file as a 
	command line argument. The demultiplexed data will be printed in a folder for the 3LTR and/or 
	5LTR with the barcodes as the name. A file will be made for each barcode combination that
	has reads that pass the filters.

4.	Run 2_blat_pipeline.pl with the path to the debarcoded data files as command line
	arguments. For example, "3LTR/PE1_D505_PE2_D706.txt". Multiple files can run files sequentially
	by putting listing more than one on path the command line.



Script lines to change:

	1_demultiplex.pl
		use lib '/path/to/files'; # Change this path to the location of the pipeline scripts.
		
	2_blat_pipeline.pl
		use lib '/path/to/files'; # Change this path to the location of the pipeline scripts.
		
		# You can filter sequences pre-alignment by defining $filter_sequence with a regular
		# expression. Default is undef.
		my $filter_sequence = "GTGGCGCC|GTCCCCCC"; 
		
		# Edit these values to suit your system.
		my $chr_ext = ".2bit"; # The extension of the chromosome files used for Blat.
		my @hg19_chrs = (1..22,"X","Y","M","Un"); # List of hg19 chromosomes for alignment
		my $path2_11ooc = "~/path/to/11.ooc"; # Location of 11.ooc file required for BLAT.			
		my $path2blat = "/Applications/Blat/blat"; # The path of the BLAT application
		my $path2hg19 = "/path/to/hg19chromFA/chr"; # The path to the human chromosome files
		my $path2HIV = "/path/to/HIV_genome/HIV1_complete_genome.$chr_ext"; # Path to the HIV genome
		my $path2uclust = "/Applications/USEARCHfolder/uclust"; # Path to the Uclust program.

Edit the settings file to be specific for your sequencing run.  The example settings file is 
shown below with descriptions. IUPAC codes can be used for ambiguous bases.

	<PE1barcodes> # Enter the LTR primer barcode(s) in this section. Enter one or more depending
	D504		  # on if you want to analyze one LTR, both, and/or check for contamination.
	D505
	<PE2barcodes> # Enter your Linker primer barcode.  The script doesn't check for this barcode
	D706		  # sequence because the MiSeq will have separated by this barcode already.
	<LTR>	# Specify in this section if you want to analyze one LTR or both.
	3LTR
	5LTR
	<3LTR_primer>  # Enter your 3LTR primer sequence.
	CCCTTTTAGTCAGTGTGGAAAATC
	<3LTR_junction> # Enter the last several bases of your 3LTR junction sequence. 
	TCTCTAGCA
	<5LTR_primer>  # Enter your 5LTR primer sequence.
	TGGGAGTGAAYTAGCCCTTC
	<5LTR_junction>  # Enter the last several bases of your 5LTR junction sequence. 
	CCCTTCCA
	<file_name_template> # Enter the name of one of your data files.
	example_MiSeq_data_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
	<pairs> # The number of Read 1 & Read 2 pairs for analysis. 1 per Miseq run but more for HiSeq.
