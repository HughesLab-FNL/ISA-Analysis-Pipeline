ISA output file descriptions:

	-	PE1_[YOUR_INDEX]_PE2_[YOUR_INDEX].txt - Contains pairs of trimmed
		reads, quality scores, and sequence ID's. the columns are:
		
		seq ID,  1, read 1 pre-junction seq, read 1 post-junction seq, Read1 quality, seq ID, 2, read 2 pre-linker seq, raed 2 post-linker seq, read 2 quality
	
	-	debarcode_log.txt and blat_log.txt - Log files of the two processes. Contain time
		stamps, filter settings, etc.
	
	-	3LTR_primer.txt and 5LTR_primer.txt - Contain the primer and junction
		sequences for later analyses.
		
	-	unique_paired-end_reads.txt - Similar to the output of 1_demultiplex.pl
		Sequences in this file have been filtered and include only those 20 bases or longer, have Q scores of
		at least 20, and that don't contain the filter sequence (if applicable) It only contains one entry for
		each unique pairs of sequences, based on the first 15 bases of the read 1 post-LTR portion and the read 2
		post-linker portion. The number of times that each pair is seen is appended to the sequence ID.
		
	-	read1_fasta_for_alignment.fa, read2_fasta_for_alignment.fa
		The fasta files used by Blat. Only contains unique pairs of sequences.
		
	-	read1_blat_results.txt, read2_blat_results.txt
		The raw blat output.
		
	-	read1_blat_results_high_quality.txt, read2_blat_results_high_quality.txt
		Contains filtered blat data. Only contains alignments that start 3 or fewer bases into the sequence, fewer
		than 10 Q-gap and T-gap bases, 20 or more matches, and greater than 95% identity.

	-	read1_blat_results_best_alignments.txt, read2_blat_results_best_alignments.txt
		Contains filtered blat data. Only contains alignments the highest scored alignment for
		each sequence ID that only match one place in the genome.
		
	-	read1_blat_results_repetitive_regions.txt, read2_blat_results_repetitive_regions.txt
		Contains the blat hits that align more than once.

	-	combined_unfiltered_match_pairs.txt - The first file to resemble the final output.
		Contains the coordinates for pairs that are found in both "best_alignments" files.
		
	-	filtered_out_unmatched_read_loci.txt - Contains only integration sites that are on the same chromosome
		and within 10 kb of one another.
		
	-	merged_integration_sites.txt - Contains the results of merging integration sites
		that have been determined to come from the same molecule bases on integration site locus,
		fragment length, read count, and molecular identifier (MID) sequence.
	
	-	annotated_integration_sites_report_with_fuzz.txt - This file is the result of adding additional 
		information to merged_filtered_integration_sites.txt. This file has 30 bases
		upstream and downstream of each integration site, the complete read 1 and
		read 2 sequences, and the approximate likelihood that the site is the result of
		mis-priming based on the similarity of the primer to the sequence upstream
		of the integration site. Contains entries labeled as fuzz or potential fuzz.
	
	-	final_annotated_integration_sites_report.txt - The last report generated. It contains
		only the reads from annotated_integration_sites_report_with_fuzz.txt that aren't labeled
		as fuzz or potential fuzz.

	-	all_read1_coordinates_for_Uclust.txt - Similar to combined_unfiltered_match_pairs.txt. Contains the
		alignment coordinates for all entries in read1_blat_results_best_alignments.txt and (if present)
		read2_blat_results_best_alignments.txt. Used to supplement the Uclust results.
	
	-	read1_sorted_by_length_for_Uclust.txt - This is a fasta file of the sequences in PEread_LTR_nonInternal_linker_long_UniquePairWct_F.fa
		sorted by descending lengths of the sequences for input for the Uclust program.
		
	-	Uclust_results_raw.txt - This file is the result of running Uclust.
	
	-	Uclust_results_reformatted_with_sequences.txt - This file is the Uclust output
		reformatted for easier reading.
		
	-	Uclust_list_of_cluster_seeds.txt - A list of the seeds used for clustering
